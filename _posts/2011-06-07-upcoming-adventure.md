Dear friends and family,

<div>
  As you may have heard by now, my good friend, Scott Bird, and I have been awarded a grant by the Chilean government to move down to Chile for a little over 6 months to start an internet company. The funding organization, <a href="http://www.startupchile.org/" target="_blank">Start-Up Chile</a>, is providing us &#8212; and 100 other teams from around the world &#8212; $40,000, office space, and access to a network of Chilean mentors and investors to help get our business off the ground.  We're still ironing out the details of our company, but as of now, it will be called <a href="http://www.bungolow.com" target="_blank">Bungolow</a>.

  I leave the second week of July with a travel companion (her passport has arrived!), and we'll be landing in Santiago in the middle of Chile's winter.

  I'll miss you all, but I'll make sure to stay in touch from the southern hemisphere. I've set up a blog at <a href="http://www.scottlthompson.com/" target="_blank">www.scottlthompson.com</a> to provide updates on the company and my experiences down in Chile.

  Time for me to go learn Spanish. I don't speak any yet&#8230;

<div>
  Best,
</div>
