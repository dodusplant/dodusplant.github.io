I am happy to report that I have joined [Stories Inherited](http://www.storiesinherited.com), a company that helps families document, preserve, and share the life stories of loved ones. Along with publishing traditional hard cover books for its customers, Stories publishes beautiful interactive books which can be viewed on an iPad.

I&rsquo;m excited to join Lauryn, the founder, in bringing innovation to the important personal history industry. I will be using my experience to grow Stories&rsquo; distribution on the web.</p> 

What excites me most about Stories Inherited is the excellence of the product itself. Stories is a member of the Association of Personal Historians, and Lauryn takes serious care in how she documents the life stories of her clients. The result is a beautiful product that will last from generation to generation, and I am excited to be a part of it.</p>
