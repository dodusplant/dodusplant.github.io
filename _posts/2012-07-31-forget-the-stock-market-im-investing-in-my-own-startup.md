<p style="text-align:left;">
  On July 11, 2011, I began selling my stocks and investing my savings into my own startup.
</p>

Obviously, the downside financial risk of investing in my own startup was much greater than the downside financial risk of investing in the S&P 500; my shares in my startup could very well be worth zero at some point, while that will (most likely) not be the case for the S&P 500.</p> 

It turns out that the risk in investing my time and money in a startup of my own was actually much more mitigated than it appears at first glance. Here&rsquo;s why:  
<span><br /><strong>Education</strong><br /></span>  
Over the past year, I have learned an incredible amount about business in general and specifically starting one. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am not on the MBA-hating bandwagon, and I do not regret receiving my MBA one bit. However, I learned a lot more in this past year starting my own company than I did in my two-year MBA program. And spent a _lot_ less money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go into the value of the MBA in a later post.</p> 

By investing in a startup of my own, I was investing in my continued education &ndash; kind of like a MGSD (Masters of Getting Stuff Done) degree.&nbsp; So even if my shares in my startup are worth zero eventually (hopefully not), it&rsquo;s easy to chalk it up as an investment in my continued education.  
<span><br /><strong>Control</strong><br /></span>  
When individual investors first start investing in stocks, they are taught that &ndash; as partial owners in the company &ndash; they can help steer the direction of the company through voting on their shares. Nuh-uh&hellip; at least not for the average U.S. individual investor. As much as you&rsquo;re told otherwise, you really have no control over the direction of a public company in which you invest. And for the few votes you get, you receive thick stacks of legalese from groups trying to sway your vote one way or another.</p> 

As the co-founder of my startup, I am one of only two people in control of my startup&rsquo;s destiny.  
<span><br /><strong>Healthy vs. Unhealthy Focus</strong><br /></span>  
As much as I tried to tell myself I was a buy-and-hold / set-it-and-forget-it investor in the stock market, I wasn&rsquo;t. I knew it&rsquo;s not worthwhile to watch the daily movements in the market, yet I would do it anyway. Watching the stock market is an unhealthy addiction. The pangs of anxiety from a down day in the stock market can&rsquo;t be good for the blood pressure. Chip Conley&rsquo;s [guest post](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/01/19/chip-conley-emotional-equations/) on Tim Ferris&rsquo;s blog is excellent, and Conley&rsquo;s anxiety equation is very applicable:</p> 

 <span></span>ANXIETY = UNCERTAINTY x POWERLESSNESS</p> 

Investing in the stock market is riddled with anxiety, because a) it is [full of uncertainty](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400067936/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hg003-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400067936) (which is why most professional investors don&rsquo;t beat the market), and b) you&rsquo;re powerless when it comes to its random movements.</p> 

I no longer helplessly watch and stress over the fickle movements of the stock market, because I have a more important, worthwhile, and healthy thing taking my attention: my startup. As stressful as running a startup can be, it is a much healthier stress. When it comes to your startup, you&rsquo;re not powerless and you can limit the uncertain things.</p> 

Forget the stock market. Invest your money and time in your own startup. You&rsquo;ll come out ahead regardless of share price.</p>
