One of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions this year will be to do a better job of keeping in touch with friends and to do so on a more regular basis.

I just spent twenty minutes implementing a system that will send me regular reminders to keep in touch with specific friends. Here&#8217;s what I did:

1) In a word processor, I put together a list of the friends I want to do a better job of keeping up with.  
2) I split those into three groups: ping every month, ping every 6 weeks, and ping every 2 months.  
3) In my google calendar, I created a new event for each person on the list, with each occurring on a different day in January. I titled the event &#8216;KIT: [friend&#8217;s name]&#8217; (KIT = Keep in Touch) and I positioned the event at the top of the given day (i.e. not at a specific time).  
4) For each calendar event:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  a) Make it repeat either every month, every six weeks, or every nine weeks, depending on where the person fell on your original list.<br /> b) Set a reminder to receive an email 0 minutes ahead of time. This will mean I&#8217;ll receive the email at midnight each day.
</p>

The important step going forward will be to not disregard these emails that will start coming in very regularly in January. I&#8217;ll report back on my progress.
