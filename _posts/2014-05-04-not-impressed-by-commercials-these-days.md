I&#8217;m tired of seeing the same old ideas being recycled again and again in TV commercials. It&#8217;s obnoxious. Isn&#8217;t there someone in the ad agencies who should know whether an idea has been done before?

Here are a couple that stick out to me as just copying one another:

**Coke Zero vs. Ford**

Coke Zero was first to the punch with this concept. Ford, thanks for reminding me that &#8220;and&#8221; is better than &#8220;or.&#8221; I had forgotten that important concept in the one year since the Coke Zero campaign came out! (Not!)





**Fidelity vs. Carmax**

But what do I do if the imaginary line on the ground is both green and says &#8220;Start&#8221;?





There are many more examples of uninspired ads out there, and I&#8217;ll try to call them out as I seem them.
